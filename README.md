# Predictive Model for Identifying Default Payment Status

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can effectively identify the default payment status of customers. The model considers various factors such as payments, bill amounts, and other relevant features available in the dataset. Using these inputs, the model predicts whether a customer will default on their payment.

## Features

- **Payments**: Historical payment records of the customers.
- **Bill Amounts**: The outstanding bill amounts for each customer over a period.
- **Other Relevant Features**: Additional features that may influence the likelihood of default.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on customer payments, bill amounts, and other attributes necessary to predict default payment status.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the entire project.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for model building.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and testing the model.

## Model Development

In this project, we developed a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will default on their payments based on the provided features. The model was trained using various machine learning algorithms, and the performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
